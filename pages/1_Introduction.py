The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a catastrophic global event, touching every corner of the world.
This unprecedented crisis led to significant changes in our daily routines, leaving an indelible impact on our lives and
the way we work, even after its conclusion. To date, nearly **704 million** individuals have been impacted by COVID-19,
with the death toll surpassing **7 million**. Notably, the United States accounts for over a million of these fatalities,
as reported by the CDC. Through this analysis, our objective is to delve into the United States' COVID-19 data to uncover
insights regarding the pandemic's effects across various regions and demographic groups. We aim to determine if certain age
groups were more susceptible to infection and also explore whether specific variables can predict mortality rates.
