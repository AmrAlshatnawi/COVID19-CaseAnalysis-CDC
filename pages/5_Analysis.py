To address our research question, we chose logistic regression as our method of analysis.
Our intention was to focus exclusively on a predefined set of variables: gender, age group, and case year, for our model.
Thus, we initiated our process by refining our dataset to solely encompass these selected predictors along with the
dependent variable, which is mortality. We streamlined the age categories into three distinct groups: 0-49 years, 50-64 years,
and 65 years and above, for clarity and simplicity. Furthermore, we adapted the case month data to extract only the year,
consolidating all cases from 2022 onwards into a single category. This approach resulted in our analysis spanning the years
2020, 2021, and "2022 or later." In preparation for logistic regression, we transformed our predictors into dummy variables.
This diligent data preparation reduced our dataset to **306,929 rows**. Below is head of the dataframe showcasing our data structure.

However, training a model on imbalanced data can lead to several challenges,
including bias towards the majority class, misleading accuracy metrics, and potential overfitting to the majority class.
To address these concerns, we implemented a resampling strategy to balance the dataset more effectively. Initially,
we undersampled the majority class using a **RandomUnderSampler**, targeting a ratio of 0.1. This ratio aimed to adjust the
dataset so that the minority class would represent approximately **10%** of the majority class's size. To further balance the
dataset, we employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique **(SMOTE)** for oversampling the minority class. With a
sampling ratio of **0.5**, our goal was to increase the minority class size to half that of the majority class post-oversampling.
This two-step resampling process was designed to mitigate the risks associated with imbalanced datasets and improve
the model's overall performance. Then we utilized the resampled data to investigate its impact on the outcomes
of the logistic regression analysis.

Upon applying the resampled data to our logistic regression model, we observed minimal changes in the results.
All predictors retained their significance, showing coefficients that were very similar to those obtained with the
original dataset. Also, the model retained its overall significance. A notable change, however, was observed in the
intercept's (constant) coefficient, which shifted from **-7.1371 to -3.8469** in terms of log odds. This shift suggests that,
within the context of a more balanced dataset, the baseline probability of death when controlling all other variables
